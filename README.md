# Generator
Generates SQLAlchemy models, Pydantic schemas, and basic crud functions to provide a starting point for CRUD based applications to work from. 

The goal is to remove much of the tedius work involved in creating medium to large sized CRUD based apps and microservices.

## Example command
* From source: `python -m ehelply_generator.ehelply_gen generate F:\Programming\Projects\eHelply\Generator\structure.json F:\Programming\Projects\eHelply\Generator\output`
* From installed package: `ehelplygen generate <input structure.json> <output directory>`
